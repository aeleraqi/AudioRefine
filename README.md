# ðŸŽ§ AudioRefine

## Project Overview ðŸ“œ

**AudioRefine** is a Google Colab notebook designed for preprocessing and refining audio data. It includes tools for:
- Loading and visualizing audio files
- Applying noise reduction and normalization techniques
- Extracting essential audio features (e.g., MFCCs, Chroma features)
- Data augmentation for machine learning tasks
- Spectrogram generation for audio analysis

This notebook is ideal for preparing audio data for tasks such as speech recognition, audio classification, and general audio analysis.

## Key Features âœ¨

- **ðŸŽ¶ Audio Loading**: Import audio files from your local device or Google Drive.
- **ðŸ”‡ Noise Reduction**: Reduce background noise using filters.
- **ðŸ“Š Normalization**: Standardize audio volume across datasets.
- **ðŸ“‰ Feature Extraction**: Extract important features like MFCCs for machine learning tasks.
- **ðŸ“ˆ Spectrograms**: Visualize audio data with spectrograms for better insight into frequency components.

## Usage in Google Colab ðŸš€

You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab. Follow these steps:

### Steps to Use:

1. **Open the Notebook in Colab**:
   - If you haven't already, upload the notebook file to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Run Cells**:
   - Simply run each cell sequentially by clicking the "Run" button.
   - Follow the steps in the notebook to load audio files, preprocess them, and extract features.

3. **Upload Your Audio Files**:
   - You can upload files from your local computer, or mount your Google Drive to access files stored there.

   Example of mounting Google Drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
